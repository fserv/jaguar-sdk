This directory has C++ files and shell scripts to benchmark
six servers running LevelDB where data is distributed with
Consistent hashing ring.

Each node should have its own file myip.txt having its own IP address.

-- reset.sh stop all servers and cleans up the data in LevelDB
-- cpprog.h  copies the fresh server program to all nodes
-- test.sh the main driver scrip to perform the processes of scaling and adding data

Test logs:
 myserv.log.10K -- myserv.log.80K
